# AI Database Manager

Small spoiler: **It's not an AI Database Manager!**

So what is it then? It's a Database Manager **by** an LLM!

To be more precise, it's from Claude (Sonnet 4.5) and is a whopping **1,778 lines** long.

I never thought my first public commit would look like this – let alone be **100%** written by an LLM. But well, here it is! A bit unprofessional xD nvm

## How long did Sonnet 4.5 take?

That's a matter of perspective. The LLM itself only took about **4-5 minutes** to write all the code.

However, I completely ran out of tokens (I have the free subscription), so I had to wait several hours. In hindsight, you could say it took 2-3 hours.

## What now?

No idea what use this code is to me, but feel free to explore it. Maybe someone can improve the visual aspect.

I can't and won't invest too much time into this. Got other things to do xD

## Features

The functions are not very special, but they still work great.

-   Complete SQLite database management
-   Create, edit and delete tables
-   Insert, edit and delete data
-   Advanced tools: VACUUM, Integrity Check, Database statistics
